# Exp-12 Constructors and Destructors

## Aim:
To explore different types of constructors, default arguments, and destructors in C++ by implementing various programs that demonstrate their use. The goal is to understand how constructors and destructors manage object initialization and cleanup, and how default arguments simplify function calls.

## Software Used:
- Dev c++
  
## Theory:
In C++, constructors are special member functions that are automatically called when an object of a class is created. They initialize the object with default or user-provided values. There are different types of constructors:

1. Default Constructor: A constructor that takes no parameters and initializes an object with default values.
2. Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes arguments to initialize an object with specific values.
3. Copy Constructor: A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

Default Arguments allow functions or constructors to be called with fewer arguments than specified, using default values for the missing arguments.

Destructors are special member functions that are called when an object is destroyed, used to perform cleanup operations.
